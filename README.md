This series of notes is based completely off of [Laracast's](https://laracasts.com/) ["Laravel from Scratch"](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch) series. As such, these notes are simply my interpretation, and sometimes direct quotes taken from Jeffrey Way, Laracasts, or the Laravel docs during the series. The same is true for most of the code samples. 

In no way should the creation of these notes be taken as a claim that I am affiliated with Laracasts in anyway, or that I am attempting to capitalize on their hard work. I am simply sharing my shorthand take away from the series.
