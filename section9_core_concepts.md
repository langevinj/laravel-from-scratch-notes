# Section 9: Core Concepts

## [Collections (ep36)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/36?autoplay=true)

If you fetch multiple elements you will receive a collection. Continuing the "Articles" example from earlier in the series. Using *Article::all();* will return to you a collection of articles.

To view the methods you can perform on a collection, find the */vendor/laravel/framework/src/Collections/Collection.php* file.

### Creating a Collection From Scratch
Simply use the *collect* method:

```
collect(['one', 'two', 'three']);
```

### Some Commonly Used Methods
- [*filter()*](#filter())
- [*map()](#map())*
- *flatMap()*
- *where()*
- *merge()*

Since a new collection is returned by each, they are all chainable.

### filter()

#### ex.
```
$items = collect([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
$items->filter(function ($item) { return $item >= 5;} );
// [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

*filter()* returns a new collection, and doesn't modify the original. If you want to access the collection, you have to save it to a variable.

### map()
Do something to each member of a collection.

#### ex.
```
$items = collect([1,2,3,4,5]);
$items->map(function ($item) { return $item * 3 });
// [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
```

### Eager Loading
A way to add further data when gathering information.

#### ex. using the *tags()* method to specify which articles to select
```
$articles = Article::with('tags')->get();
```
This returns a collection of all Articles, but each article also has a 'tags' collection.

## [CSRF Attacks, With Examples (ep37)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/37?autoplay=true)
This section is best understood by watching the video.

From wikipedia: 
>"In a CSRF attack an innocent end user is tricked by an attacker into submitting a web request that they did not intend.

### Broken Img Tag
In this example, the 'target' website uses a GET request for its logout route. The attacker website can add a broken *img* tag to the loading screen of the attacker site, with the source set to the logout route for the target site, meaning on load, it will logout a user.

#### ex. *at the bottom of the attacker welcome page*
```
<img src="http://target.test/logout">
```

### False Button

#### ex. *at the bottom of the attacker welcome page*
```
<form method="POST" action="http://target.test/logout">
    <button>Continue</button>
</form>
```
This can be aided by a hidden AJAX request in the backend. Laravel automatically tries to protect from this by using a token for the actual session.

### @csrf directive

As mentioned in Section 5 on forms, the *@csrf* directive adds a hidden input to, for example, the logout form. This adds another level of verification.

When you are creating a form that submits a POST, PUT, or DELETE request, make it a habit to add *@csrf*.

## [Service Container Fundamentals (ep38)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/38?autoplay=true)

A container for services. A place to store and retrieve services. 

This lesson rapidly went through creating your own container, without much stopping for explaination. So I would recommend checking out the [Laravel docs on this subject](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/container)


### An exmaplaination from the docs *(paraphrased from the docs directly)*
The service container is a tool for managing class dependencies, and injecting dependencies into a class via the constructor or "setter" methods.

## [Level 1 - The Best Introduction To the Service Container](https://laravelcoreadventures.com/raiders-of-the-lost-service-container/level/1)

I took a quick sidebar to check out this video for further explaination for the Laravel service container.

Laravel can tell when we need to create an instance of a class and inject it into another method.

#### ex. *taken from this vide*
```
use App\Exporter\UserStatsCsvExporter;

class ExportController extends Controller
{

    public function handle(UserStatsCsvExporter $userStatsExporter)
    {
        return $userStatsExport->export(12);
    }
}
```
So in this example, Laravel will know to create a new instance of the *UserStatsCsvExporter* class.

>"**Providers** are the main place to configure your application. You can use them to register services while Laravel boots up."

### Adding the Provider
You need to register your provider in the */config/app.php* file.

#### ex. *inside the app.php 'providers' array*
```
UserStatsExporterProvider::class
```

Then, inside the provider, in the *register* method, we bind something to the container.

```
public function register()
{
    $this->app->bind(UserStatsCsvExporter::class, function(){
        return new UserStatsCsvExporter(new Translator(config('app.locale)));
    });
}
```
Telling Laravel how to create the instance when we want to inject the class. This mean we want to return a new instance of the *UserStatsCsvExporter* and provide dependencies of the exporter.

 We can also directly ask the container for an instance.

 >'The service container helps us manage our dependencies by:
 >1. providing auto-resolving
 >2. giving us a central place to store instantiation information
 >3. letting us bind to interfaces
 >4. giving us the opportunity to share instances'

---
## [Automatically Resolve Dependencies (ep39)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/39?autoplay=true)

### Laravel's Container
Laravel's container is the application itself and can refereneced using the *app()* helper function.

#### ex. *in the web.php file*
```
app()->bind('example', function() {
    return new \App\Example();
});
```

So we now have a new key bound in the service container.

### Fetching a Service

One way is using the *resolve()* helper. 

```
Route::get('/', function() {
    resolve('example');
});
```

The bound method will resolve to whatever is bound to that key.
